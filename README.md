## Installation
VScode (or equivalent), Node.js, npm Inquirer 8.2.4

## Usage
For this program, open the code inside a development environment like VScode. Open the terminal window. In terminal, navigate to the directory path of the index.js file. Once in the same directory as the index.js, enter "node index.js" to initialize the program. Answer questions as prompted by typing in responses. When prompted for license, use the arrow keys to select between the choices. Upon completing the questionnaire, the console should log "Success!". The current directory should now have a fully written README with the user's answers incorporated into the document structure.
