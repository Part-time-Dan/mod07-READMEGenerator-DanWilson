# Pop-Up Survey

## Description
The goal of this project is to offer a simple, dynamic pop-up survey module that can be added to a website or injected into existing code that is used in browser. The user can program as many cards as needed and have different options available for how inputs are collected, such as write-in fields, checkboxes/radios, buttons, etc. The survey will then store the data collected and also present anonymous results tallied from other users of the same survey if desired.

## Installation
NPM module download and package added to your code

## Usage
The host will offer the package as a front-end link to incoming requests. Users will interface with the application and give it the parameters to generate the survey. The user will be presented with prompts for number of questions to generate. For each question, the user may choose the form of input. If the input is multi-choice, then the user provides the additional answer options. The user will finally be given a generated link of the survey that they then can share with others. Each new access event to the application will log and store survey responses for user processing, and return survey statistics to responders. 

## Contributions
Contributions will be accepted on a case by case basis. Please see the Questions section for contact information to reach the developers for contributions.

## Tests
Two test modules are included, one to verify the module independently. Another to test the module once integrated into the host environment.
